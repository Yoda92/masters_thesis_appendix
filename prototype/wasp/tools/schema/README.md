# Schema Tool

The Schema tool will (re-)generate the entire interface library and implementation 
skeleton for a smart contract from a schema definition file. The idea behind the Schema 
tool is that the programmer will be relieved from as many burdens as possible. This means 
that the Schema tool will generate code a lot of boilerplate code within a standardized 
folder structure. It will also provide a strongly typed interface to the smart contract 
function parameters, return values, and to the smart contract's state storage.

The code generator of the Schema tool has been thoroughly tested, which means that you can
be sure that the generated code is bug-free, and you can focus on the implementation of
the smart contract without distractions. Any time changes are made to the smart contract 
interface by the programmer in the schema definition file, the Schema tool will 
automatically re-generate any affected code to reflect these changes.

## Installation

Clone the [Wasp repository](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp) and run 
```shell
go install ./tools/schema
```
If you want to use the demo smart contracts, immediately after cloning the repository run
```shell
make wasm
```

### Setting up an initial smart contract folder

You can use the Schema tool to generate an initial folder with a default schema 
definition file by using `schema -init MySmartContract` where `MySmartContract` is a 
user-defined camel-case name for the smart contract.

The Schema tool will create a sub-folder `mysmartcontract` (all lower case) for the smart 
contract, with a default `schema.yaml` in it that describes a minimal contract with the 
provided name, and can be used to generate a complete working contract later on.

The initial `schema.yaml` contains all sections necessary to completely define the smart 
contract interface. You will modify this schema definition file to include additional 
interface requirements for your smart contract and then use the Schema tool to 
(re-)generate the interface in the desired language(s).

You can check out our demo smart contracts in the contracts/wasm folder of the
[Wasp repository](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp) to see how to use the different 
sections, or check the (somewhat outdated, coming soon) documentation on the 
[IOTA wiki](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/smart-contracts/guide/wasm_vm/schema/).

The initial `schema.yaml` looks like this:

```yaml
name: MySmartContract
author: ""
copyright: ""
description: MySmartContract description
license: ""
repository: ""
version: 0.0.1
events: {}
structs: {}
typedefs: {}
state:
  owner: AgentID # current owner of this smart contract
funcs:
  init:
    params:
      owner: AgentID? # optional owner of this smart contract
  setOwner:
    access: owner # current owner of this smart contract
    params:
      owner: AgentID # new owner of this smart contract
views:
  getOwner:
    results:
      owner: AgentID # current owner of this smart contract
```

### Generating the smart contract interface

Once `schema.yaml` has been modified to your liking you can use the Schema tool to
(re-)generate the interface code in the desired language(s). To do this you navigate into 
the folder that contains `schema.yaml` and run the Schema tool with one or more of the 
language flags:

- `schema -go` to generate the Go interface and implementation
- `schema -rs` to generate the Rust interface and implementation
- `schema -ts` to generate the Typescript interface and implementation

You can provide multiple language flags if you want. For example `schema -go -rs -ts` 
will generate all three language interfaces and implementations.

Normally the Schema tool will only generate new code when the schema definition file 
or the Schema tool itself is newer than the last generated code. If for some reason you 
need to override this behavior you can use the `-force` flag to force code generation.

The Schema Tool will generate a sub-folder for each separate language. These sub-folders 
will in turn each have several specific sub-folders:

- `mysmartcontract` This library/crate sub-folder contains the interface code that can be
  used to invoke the smart contract functions from within a smart contract, from within a
  test environment, or from within a client application. This interface code should never
  be modified by the user.
- `mysmartcontractimpl` This library/crate sub-folder contains the implementation code for
  the smart contract functions. The generated code is specific to the functioning of the
  smart contract. The user should modify `funcs.xx`, which contains the user-defined
  function implementations for the smart contract, with the required smart contract logic.
  The file `thunks.xx` contains some glue code to properly set up function invocation
  from the Wasm VM. This glue code should never be modified by the user.
- `mysmartcontractwasm` This crate sub-folder will only be generated for Rust code. The
  crate contains the Wasm stub that is necessary to combine the interface code and
  implementation code when building the Wasm binary file. The other languages achieve the
  same thing by using a single stub source file called `main.xx`, which does not need its
  own sub-folder. This stub code should never be modified by the user.

Note that the Schema Tool will make it very clear which files should not
be touched by the user by inserting a comment at the first line of the generated files
which clearly specifies:

```go
// Code generated by schema tool; DO NOT EDIT.
```

### Building the smart contract

The Schema tool will also build the smart contract for you. To be able to do that it 
requires that the proper compilers have already been installed and can be reached 
through your execution PATH. These are the required compilers for each language:

- [Go](https://go.dev/) version 1.21 or higher with [tinygo](https://tinygo.org/) version
  0.27 or higher.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) version 1.69 or higher with
  [wasm-pack](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack) version 0.11 or higher.
- [Typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) version 5.0 or higher with 
  [Assemblyscript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/) version 0.27 or higher.

The Schema tool will standardize the naming and location of the compiled Wasm code so 
that the `Solo` stand-alone test environment will automatically be able to find the Wasm 
code and deploy it for you in your tests.

To build the desired Wasm binaries simply add the `-build` flag to the desired language 
flags. For example, `schema -go -rs -ts -build` will build the Wasm binaries for all 
supported languages.

### Cleaning up after yourself

The Schema tool will normally generate quite a lot of code. Sometimes you will want to 
be able to clean up all generated artifacts. To that end the Schema tool provides the 
`-clean` flag. Add this flag to the desired language flags to clean up the artifacts 
for the specified languages. Note that this will leave files modified by the user alone. 

You may want to make sure that the artifact files do not end up in your repository, 
since they can be re-generated at any time. There is a `.gitignore` file in the 
`contracts/wasm` folder of the Wasp repository that shows how to achieve this.
