// an unlimited amount of bets on a number during a timed betting round. Once a betting round
// is over the contract will automatically pay out the winners proportionally to their bet amount.
// The intent is to showcase basic functionality of WasmLib and timed calling of functions
// through a minimal implementation and not to come up with a complete real-world solution.
