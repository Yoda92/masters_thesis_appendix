## WasmClient for Rust

`WasmClient` allows developers to use Rust to create smart contracts for ISCP that
compile into Wasm and can run directly on ISCP-enabled Wasp nodes and on the
Solo environment.

`WasmClient` treats the programming of smart contracts as simple access to a
key/value data and token storage where smart contract properties, request
parameters, token balances and the smart contract state can be accessed in a
universal, consistent way.

The _wasmclient_ folder provides the interface to the VM sandbox provided by the
Wasp node through _ScFuncContext_ and _ScViewContext_.
