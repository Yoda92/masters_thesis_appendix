## WasmLib for Rust

`WasmLib` allows developers to use Rust to create smart contracts for ISC that
compile into Wasm and can run directly on ISC-enabled Wasp nodes and on the
Solo environment.

`WasmLib` treats the programming of smart contracts as simple access to a
key/value data and token storage where smart contract properties, request
parameters, token balances and the smart contract state can be accessed in a
universal, consistent way.

The _wasmlib_ folder provides the interface to the VM sandbox provided by the
Wasp node through _ScFuncContext_ and _ScViewContext_.
