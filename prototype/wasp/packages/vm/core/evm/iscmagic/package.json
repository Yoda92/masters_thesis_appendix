  "description": "The Magic contract is an EVM contract deployed by default on every ISC chain, in the EVM genesis block, at address 0x1074000000000000000000000000000000000000. The implementation of the Magic contract is baked-in in the evm core contract); i.e. it is not a pure-Solidity contract. The Magic contract has several methods, which are categorized into specialized interfaces: ISCSandbox, ISCAccounts, ISCUtil and so on. You can access these interfaces from any Solidity contract by importing the ISC library. The Magic contract also provides proxy ERC20 contracts to manipulate ISC base tokens and native tokens on L2.",
