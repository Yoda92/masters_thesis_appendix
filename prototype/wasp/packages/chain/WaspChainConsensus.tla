-------------------------- MODULE WaspChainConsensus ---------------------------
(*
This specification models interaction of a consensus log with the L1 chain.

  - Here the "L1 chain" is considered as a chain of Alias Output TXes
    forming the chain's history/execution at L1. We consider TX rejections
    and L1 reorganizations in this spec.

  - And "Consensus Log" stands for a series of consensus round outputs, as it
    is common in the replicated state machine approach. In the case of L1 reorg
    the consensus log is not truncated in any way, it just picks other alias
    output as a basis for the next entry in the consensus log.

It is possible that:

  - A single entry in the Consensus Log gives a rise several Alias Outputs on L1.
    E.g. we have more outputs, that can fit to a TX, thus we are making several
    of them. We don't model this in the current specification.

  - Some Consensus Log Entries can produce no Alias Output's at all. E.g. there is
    no messages to execute, or there is no agreement on the alias output to
    use as a basis. Such Consensus Log Entries are still stored and maintained.

  - Alias Output indexes can proceed non-monotonously in the consensus log, e.g.
    a produced TX was rejected by L1, thus we have go back to the latest known
    unspent alias output and build on it.

See TODO marks bellow for open questions.

`^\center{\textbf{COMMITTEE NODE}}^'

Here we model actions of the nodes in the chain's committee. The main goal
is to model node's interaction with the L1 Chain and the Consensus.
The committee has to handle rejects and reorgs in L1, agree on the next
log entry by choosing an alias output to use as an input for the next TX.

The main idea is that if the nodes consider different alias outputs to use,
after some time they will get synchronized, because L1 here the the source
of this information, and it will be synchronized to all the correct nodes
after some time.

(*
From time to time, a node receives confirmed and unspent outputs from the L1.
This action makes the nodes resynchronize, if something bad happened.
We can have several scenarios here:

  - An Alias Output was just posted to L1, it was confirmed and we got it
    here from L1. That's the main "sunny day" scenario.

  - It is possible that we have posted a TX (and stored it in nodeLastOut to
    support the pipelining), but L1 rejected it. We will get the older Alias
    Output here and will have to agree with other nodes to go back one step.

      - A race condition is possible here: it is possible that we have posted a
        TX, it was not rejected, and not yet confirmed. We will get te previous
        Alias Output as the last unspent during that time and will see it in our
        log of decisions. That makes it unclear, if we have to go back, or wait
        for other confirmations. `^\textbf{//TODO: What to do with it?}^'.

      - One possible solution is for a node to post old TX'es in the descending
        order until it will receive no rejection. This way the chain can know,
        if its local state is outdated and the one reported by L1 node is the
        correct one.

  - It is possible that we will receive newer alias output (if we are lagging
    with our consensus proposals and decisions), or other unseen alias outputs
    (in the case of reorg). In these cases, we don't see these outputs in our
    log, so we just take them and propose in the next step.

`^\textbf{//TODO: This action makes synchronization quite strict. It only
pushes the single globally known last unspent TX to all the nodes. Such an
assumption can be inappropriate in reality. Older/outdated outputs can be
pushed by some nodes, not to mentioning the byzantine ones.}^'

(*
A node proposes a base output ID for a particular log index.
It makes the proposals only for the first pending log index, thus
proposals are done in lock step with the decisions from the consensus.

That doesn't mean we wait for something from L1. In the success scenario
we will always propose `nodeLastOut[n]' as an alias output to use as a base.
This variable set only when a transaction is posted by this node, or a
confirmed output is received from L1. Thus, we mark this node as already sent
the proposal, by making `nodeLastOut[n] = AONull' to avoid repeating
consensus with the same output.

AUX: Decision on the first log entry will always be made, because we don't
consider reorgs for the initial state (that would mean deletion of a chain).

(*
Initial state [0] stays not reverted in this spec, so we have to agree on the next [1] TX.
The state index [1] can be reverted after being confirmed and the TX itself can be
rejected, thus we can't check if `1 \in StateSeq ~> l1Chain[1] # NullOutputId'.
